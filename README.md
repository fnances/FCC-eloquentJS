# FCC-eloquentJS
Training JS with my mentor.

My mentor gave me an list of exercises for me, after that he corrected all errors and gave me some advices about writing code. Thanks to him I improved myself a lot and I feel pretty ready for first job despite I still work with him. Some of exercises may feel not connected to real job tasks but mostly they are must haves for a good coder. Traverse the branches and admire, because despite the fact these are not high level programming tasks I believe they are all done proffessionaly.
