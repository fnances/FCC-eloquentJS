# FCC-eloquentJS
Training JS with my mentor.

List of exercises / small projects I have done recently. Just switch the branches.

- all Front End Developer FreeCodeCamp projects and algorithmic skills.
-  EloquentJS exercises from chapters 1 - 9 
- drag and drop image processing application.

Ignore sloppy UI - that was not the point of these exercises.
